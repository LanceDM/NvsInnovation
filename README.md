Pytorch - for training model and model implementation using st-gcn, strong support for graph neural networks compared to tensorFlow

yolov8 - for built in multiple-object detection, better compared to others pag multiple object detection

blazepipe - faster than mediapipe for skeletal mapping, better optimized and offers reduced latency
