Pytorch - for training model and model implementation using st-gcn, strong support for graph neural networks compared to tensorFlow

yolov5 - built in multiple-object detection, fast and lightweight

blazepipe - faster than mediapipe for skeletal mapping, better optimized and offers reduced latency 

Requirements:
  python 3.8 - 3.11
  cuda if you have GPU
